<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <img src="./media-rec/src/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="1000">

MediaRec is a songs and movies recommender that allows for an easy experience by just searching songs and/or movies and getting recommendations with the click of a button.

Core features:
* Connects with Spotify so you can search songs from Spotify or choose songs from your playlists.
* Recommends songs using a **custom built algorithm**, and allows you to save as a playlist to your Spotify account.
* Movie search is done with the TMDB API, so even the newest movies can be used.
* We DO NOT store any user data â€” log in is through Spotify only, and you can see the permissions when logging in. 

<br />

### Built With
